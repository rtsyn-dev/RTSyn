- **period_us**: Total time between process calls (actual period)
- **latency_us**: Only measures delays (when > expected period) - always ≥ 0
- **jitter_us**: Standard deviation of recent periods - measures timing variation (both early/late)
- **compute_time_us**: Processing overhead (latency - how much longer than expected)
- **realtime_violation**: 1.0 if latency exceeds max_latency_us threshold
