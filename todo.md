[test] Comedi plugin

- [replicate] When period is 100 us and window 10\*3500 plot isn't complete and the more I increment the window the less is shown (max points draw related, I think)

- [ ] Python library cpython
- [ ] Python plugin development
- [ ] Create a plugin that can help creating plugins
- [ ] Impove, change and refactor the plotter: It shall generate plots from different inputs, this should be the y value and the x the time (period of collection)
- [ ] Let the installed plugins be organized in folders (virtual view), there is one reserved for the System ones
- [ ] Allow changing the color of the plotter lines and names
- [ ] When confirmation dialog is shown, the connections on background dissapear visually while is shown.
- [ ] When you right click on empty space (not plugin or window), a menu with Add plugin must appear
- [ ] Fix warning `warning: the following packages contain code that will be rejected by a future version of Rust: ashpd v0.8.1`
- [x] Click to highlight the connections must be ON the plugin (right now, if you click a window over the plugin they highlight). Instead of one click, do te connection highlighting activation and deactivation with double click.
- [x] If a plugin is deleted, reuse id
- [ ] Ensure cores are being used
- [ ] Windows must be on top of plugins and connection hover info always (but not over the tabs on top (Workspace Plugins ...))
- [x] New workspace should load the new empty workspace after creation
- [x] Fix spacing of letters in descriptions
- [x] Make workspaces on Workspace load and workspace manage list bigger and a bit separated
- [x] export workspace file dialog should have the default name of the workspace
- [x] Notify the loading of workspace "Workspace 'name' loaded"
- [x] Notify when period frequency are applied. Name it "Time scale" and as description put "Sampling rate updated"
- [x] Refactor plugin to better programming of the gui
- [x] Loading wheel to the right of the text
- [x] Right click over a plugin with a window over it shows the plugin right click menu (it shouldn't)
- [ ] Make workspace (cargo rust) a package
- [ ] Add different connections (shared memory and pipes)
- [ ] Performance tests
- [x] Hover connections are shown on top of other windows
- [x] max_latency_us should be max_latency and have a input similar of the settings (the value and the units)
- [x] Eliminate dot of end of phrase for notifications
- [x] Deleting a plugin closes the window and references from it. Reinstalling it closes them and reopens them (with same connections)
- [x] Allow "intenal" variables (that are shown on variables section)
- [x] Add runtime support for per-port input values and internal variables display in plugin view (extend LogicState with input_values and variable_values HashMaps)
- [x] fix reset button (should restart monitored variables)
- [x] Instead of none inputs in plugin preview, when extendable inputs, show "incremental"
- [x] For actual csv recorder and live plotter: make number of inputs and on/off internal variables instead of actual special view (which shall be removed)
- [x] Performance monitor doesn't show the variables and outputs
- [x] On stop button it iterates one more time on showing outputs
- [ ] While stopped, some plugins (like live plotter) arn't showing correctly the info
- [-] Replace the config characteristics on csv and plotter to part of the plugin and make plugin config only for general config
- [ ] Refactor app_plugins code so its generic and follows similar loading as the dynamic plugins.
- [x] Eliminate cross from plotter
- [x] Check if cached plugin is deleted when reinstalled (it should, plugin updates) and delete instances of same kind plugin that is open
- [x] Close "no hooked windows". This is basically that if I have a Plugin config window opened and I change workspaces, remove the plugin etc, it should dissapear
- [x] dont allow plugins of same kind to be installed twice
- [x] Make the Variables, Input/s, Output/s and Internal Variable/s be plegable sections if clicked a down arrow as same level as the section name. Also make them follow this order: Variables, Internal Variable/s, Input/s and Output/s
- [x] Cant add different outputs to different inputs between same plugins when a connection is already made
- [x] Visual bug on some plugins where the x is not on top right and the grey top part is not as wide as the plugin
- [x] When all inputs connections deleted, close the live plotter
- [ ] Fix csv recorder path button
- [ ] On workspace deletion, if its loaded it shall return to default workspace
- [ ] Workspace created doesnt show the name
